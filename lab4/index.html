			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to psuedocode an everyday task and a computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had difficulty understanding typical langauge used in code, which made it difficult to transfer to pseudocode.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We successfully wrote psuedocode for making a Ristretto coffee as well as writing out the high level and specific pseudocode for a ping-pong game. Both of these were inserted into our html file.</p>

	<h1> Ristretto Coffee Steps</h1>
	<pre><code>
		1.	Use 18 grams of espresso roast coffee for a double shot 
		2.	Grind the coffee until very fine 
		3.	Add the coffee grounds to an espresso basket (portafilter) until heaping over the top
		4.	Place the portafilter in a folded towel
		5.	Use a tamper to firmly press grounds evenly into the portafilter
		6.	Ensure coffee grounds are as even as possible 
		7.	Place the portafilter in the espresso machine 
		8.	Press the button to pull the shot using Manually Mode
		9.	Make sure it lasts 15 to 20 seconds and results in 1 1/2 ounces of coffee with a cream-colored crema 
		10.	Enjoy!
	</code></pre>
	<h1> Ping-Pong Game Steps</h1>
	<pre><code>
		1. Initialize game variables 
		2. Print the score of players before each round 
		3. Accept user input 
		4. Update player 1 and 2 inputs 
		5. Update ball position 
		6. Check for collision with walls and paddles
		7. Test win condition based on player score of 10 
	</code></pre>
	<pre><code>
	// Initialize player 1 score to 0  
// Initialize player 2 score to 0  
// Initialize ball position x axis (ball_x) to 0  
// Initialize ball position y axis (ball_y) to 0 
// Initialize derivative with respect to x of ball (ball_dx) to 1 
// Initialize derivative with respect to y of ball (ball_dy) to 1 
// Set winning store to 10 
// Print score of each player starting at 0

// multiply the current value of ball_dx by -1 which reverses the direction of the horizontal motion    
	// If player 1 score is equal to 10, 
// Print “player 1 is the winner”
// If player 2 score is equal to 10, 
// Print “player 2 is the winner”
