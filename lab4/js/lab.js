// Ping_Pong 
// An implementation of the game 
// index.js - the purpose of this psuedocode is to draft out the steps of playing a game of ping pong

// Initialize player 1 score to 0  
// Initialize player 2 score to 0  
// Initialize ball position x axis (ball_x) to 0  
// Initialize ball position y axis (ball_y) to 0 
// Initialize derivative with respect to x of ball (ball_dx) to 1 
// Initialize derivative with respect to y of ball (ball_dy) to 1 
// Set winning store to 10 
// Print score of each player starting at 0 
// Loop while true: 
// If key “w” is pressed, player 1 score is subtracted by 1  point
	// Update player 1 score
	// Print player 1 score
// Else-if “s” is pressed, player 1 score is added 1 point
	// Update Player 1 score
	// Print player 1 score
// If “up arrow” is pressed, player 2 score is subtracted by 1 point 
// Update player 2 score
	// Print player 2 score
// Else-if  “down arrow” is pressed, player 2 score is added 1 point 
// Update player 2 score
	// Print player 2 score
 // Update the the ball_x variable by adding the ball_dx variable to it 
//  Update the the ball_y variable by adding the ball_dy variable to it 
	// if ball_y is equal to 0
// subtract 1 from ball_dy 
// if ball_x is equal to 0
	// Player 2 score is added 1 point 
	// Reset ball position
// else if ball_x is equal to the screen width - 1
	// Player 1 score is added 1 point 
	// Reset ball position
// if ball_x is equal to 1 and player 1 score is less than or equal to ball_y which is less than player 1 score plus the paddle height 
// Multiply the current value of ball_dx by -1 which reverses the direction of the horizontal motion    
// Else-if ball_x is equal to screen width - 2 and player 2 score is less than or equal to ball_y which is less than player 2 score plus the paddle height 
// multiply the current value of ball_dx by -1 which reverses the direction of the horizontal motion    
	// If player 1 score is equal to 10, 
// Print “player 1 is the winner”
// If player 2 score is equal to 10, 
// Print “player 2 is the winner”
