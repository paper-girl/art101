			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab's challenge was to learn how Javascript arrays and objects function and experiment with those features.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was very hard at first to use the console to write the JS code. I am unfamiliar with coding so I made many errors, and could not go back and change them so I had to re-do it multiple times. But after a few tries I got the hang of it and the act of repetition actually helped me in the long run to better understand what I was doing. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This project went really well because my parnter and I both came to it with different levels of experience and were able to learn a lot. I learned a lot from my parnter who was a lot more expeirecned in programming, and she got to brush up on her skills by teaching me. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>My parnter and I were able to successfully code arrays and objects for our modes of transportation.</p>
