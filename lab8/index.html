                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>The challenge was experimenting with anon functions in javascript and using arrays.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="minor-section">
                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>When creating the functions initially, we struggled to get them to work.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>I think we did well in problem solving in order to figure out how to get the functions and arrays to work. We learned a lot about how these operations occur.</p>

                    <h2>Script Output Results</h2>
                    <p>We successfully created functions and arrays that worked. See console for results!</p>
