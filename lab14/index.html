                    <p>Debugging old labs and finding solutions to previous issues that came up.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>We struggled at first with figuring out how to add the party feature to our lab 11. But after researching a bit and looking at the professor's code we were able to add it.</p>

                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>Overall, this was a good experience because it forced us to really look at our code and examine every small detail to figure out what went wrong. This makes us stronger programmers because it helps with attention to detail. And we learned from our mistakes!</p>
